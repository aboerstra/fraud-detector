## Technical Requirements

### Performance Metrics Focus
1. **Precision** - Minimize false positives (customer experience)
2. **Recall** - Catch actual fraud (loss prevention)
3. **F1-Score** - Balanced measure
4. **AUC-ROC** - Model discrimination ability
5. **Business Metrics** - Cost savings, review reduction

### User Experience Principles
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple → Advanced modes
- **Plain English**: Business-friendly explanations
- **Visual Indicators**: Traffic lights, progress bars, status badges
- **Contextual Help**: Tooltips and explanations throughout
- **Error Prevention**: Validation and guided workflows

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI, LightGBM, SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: Laravel Blade, Bootstrap 5, Chart.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL (existing)
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with versioning
- **Queue System**: Laravel Queues (existing)

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Users can upload training data and start training jobs
- [ ] Training progress is visible in real-time
- [ ] Model performance can be evaluated and compared
- [ ] Models can be deployed to production safely
- [ ] System provides clear feedback and error messages

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Training jobs complete within reasonable time (< 30 minutes for typical datasets)
- [ ] UI is responsive and intuitive for non-technical users
- [ ] System handles training failures gracefully
- [ ] All operations are logged and auditable
- [ ] Performance metrics are accurate and meaningful

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- [ ] Training job failures → Implement robust error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Large dataset handling → Add file size limits and streaming processing
- [ ] Model deployment issues → Implement rollback and validation checks
- [ ] Performance degradation → Add monitoring and alerting

### User Experience Risks
- [ ] Complex interface → Implement progressive disclosure and guided workflows
- [ ] Unclear results → Add plain English explanations and visualizations
- [ ] Training confusion → Provide contextual help and documentation

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Phase 1 (Foundation & Database)
- **Week 3-4**: Phase 2 (Core Training System)
- **Week 5-6**: Phase 3 (User Interface Development)
- **Week 7-8**: Phase 4 (Advanced Features & Polish)

## Notes
- Focus on LightGBM algorithm only
