## Executive Summary

The model training interface demonstrates strong foundational UX principles but has several critical usability issues that could impede user success, particularly for less technical users. The interface successfully implements progressive disclosure and provides comprehensive functionality, but suffers from information architecture problems, inconsistent mental models, and accessibility concerns.

**Overall Usability Score: 6.8/10**

### Key Strengths
- Progressive disclosure with beginner/advanced options
- Comprehensive dashboard with clear metrics
- Well-structured wizard workflow
- Strong visual hierarchy and modern design

### Critical Issues
- Navigation confusion between "Testing" and "Model Training"
- Cognitive overload in dashboard presentation
- Inconsistent error handling and feedback
- Limited accessibility considerations

## Detailed Findings by Heuristic

### 1. Visibility of System Status (Score: 7/10)

**Strengths:**
- Loading spinners provide immediate feedback during operations
- Training job status badges clearly indicate current state
- System health indicators show real-time service status
- Progress tracking through wizard steps

**Issues:**
- **Critical:** No progress indicators for long-running training jobs
- **Major:** Unclear what happens after clicking "Start Training" - users left wondering
- **Minor:** Polling status updates could be more prominent

**Recommendations:**
```html
<!-- Add progress bar for training jobs -->
<div class="progress mb-3">
    <div class="progress-bar progress-bar-striped progress-bar-animated" 
         style="width: 45%">Training in progress... (45%)</div>
</div>

<!-- Add estimated completion time -->
<small class="text-muted">Estimated completion: 12 minutes remaining</small>
```

### 2. Match Between System and Real World (Score: 5/10)

**Strengths:**
- "Training Wizard" metaphor is intuitive

    const warnings = [];
    
    if (dataset.quality_score < 0.7) {
        warnings.push("Dataset quality is below recommended threshold (70%)");
    }
    
    if (dataset.record_count < 1000) {
        warnings.push("Small dataset may result in poor model performance");
    }
    
    return warnings;
}
```

### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall (Score: 7/10)

**Strengths:**
