## Documentation Structure

Each component document follows a consistent structure:

- **Overview** - Component purpose and responsibilities
- **Architecture** - Technical design and data flow
- **Implementation** - Code examples and interfaces
- **Configuration** - Setup and configuration options
- **Local Development** - Development environment setup
- **Testing** - Unit and integration testing approaches
- **Monitoring** - Observability and metrics
- **Security** - Security considerations and compliance

## Getting Started

1. **System Overview** - Start with the main [README.md](../README.md) for system architecture
2. **Component Deep Dive** - Read individual component documentation for implementation details
3. **Local Setup** - Follow setup instructions in each component for development environment
4. **API Reference** - Use the API examples in the main README for integration

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Features

1. **Design Phase**
   - Review relevant component documentation
   - Understand data flow and interfaces
   - Plan integration points

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Follow coding patterns from component docs
   - Implement tests as described in testing sections
   - Update configuration as needed

3. **Documentation Phase**
   - Update component documentation
   - Add code examples and configuration
   - Update API reference if needed

### Troubleshooting

Each component document includes:
- Common issues and solutions
- Debugging techniques
- Performance optimization tips
- Error handling patterns

## Architecture Decisions

### Design Principles

1. **Modularity** - Each component is independently deployable
2. **Observability** - Comprehensive logging and metrics
3. **Testability** - Mock services and test data provided
4. **Security** - Privacy-first design with audit trails
5. **Scalability** - Asynchronous processing and caching

### Technology Choices

- **Laravel** - Mature PHP framework with excellent queue support
- **PostgreSQL** - ACID compliance and JSON support for flexibility
- **LightGBM** - Fast, accurate gradient boosting for fraud detection
- **AWS Bedrock** - Managed LLM service with privacy controls
- **FastAPI** - High-performance Python API framework

### Trade-offs

- **Consistency vs Availability** - Chose consistency for fraud decisions
- **Latency vs Accuracy** - Balanced with 5-minute SLA and multi-modal scoring
- **Cost vs Performance** - Optimized LLM usage with token limits and caching
- **Complexity vs Maintainability** - Modular design for long-term maintenance

## Deployment Considerations

### Local Development
- All components runnable locally
- Mock services for external dependencies
- Sample data for testing
- Hot reload for development

### Production Readiness
- Infrastructure as code (Terraform)
- Container deployment (Docker)
- Monitoring and alerting
- Security hardening
